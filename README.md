NUnit Project Editor
====================

This editor understands the format of NUnit project files and may be used to edit them.
The project file format has not changed between NUnit V2 and NUnit 3+, so the program
is useful in either context and project files may be shared between the two versions
of NUnit.

The editor consists of a single executable, which may be downloaded and run from any 
convenient location.
