NUnit-Project-Editor 0.9.0 - February 12, 2011

Initial independent release of the project editor. This release is identical (except for the release number) to the version that was previously bundled with NUnit 2.6.4. It is classified as a pre-1.0 release because of changes needed for it to function well in conjunction with later versions of NUnit.
