Should be able to add an assembly that does not exist on
the current system, since the editing may be done on
a different machine or under a different user id.

Need NUnit Icon for this program.

Move Assemblies up and down in the list.

Move Configs up and down in the list.

Allow selecting multiple assemblies to be added.

All paths should use forward slashes for cross-platform
compatibility.

Need a toolbar
