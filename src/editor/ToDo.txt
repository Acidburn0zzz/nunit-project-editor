Should be able to add an assembly that does not exist on
the current system, since the editing may be done on
a different machine or under a different user id.

Need NUnit Icon for this program.

Move Assemblies up and down in the list.

Move Configs up and down in the list.

Adding a new config doesn't copy the config selected
as a model.

Allow selecting multiple assemblies to be added.

Error setting Project Base to empty

Newly added assemblies use full path rather than relative

Need a toolbar
